# Crime-Analysis
This program takes input from two files: a crime codes file and a crime report file. Following the parsing of the input, the program displays the first and last three of the crime codes. In addition, it displays the first and last three crimes to have occurred in the date range displayed at the beginning. Finally, it outputs the top 5 crimes according to how often they occurred. 

There are 4 input files provided: 2 crime codes files and 2 crime reports files. The latter of both types of files are significantly larger in size in order to test the program against a larger input size.
